Getting Started

  The Hadoop documentation includes the information you need to get started using
  Hadoop. Begin with the
  {{{./hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/SingleCluster.html}Single Node Setup}} which
  shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation. Then move on to the
  {{{./hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ClusterSetup.html}Cluster Setup}} to learn how
  to set up a multi-node Hadoop installation.
